"math/9201210",,"Paulette Saab","Integral Operators on Spaces of Continuous Vector-valued Functions",,,,"Banach Archive 3/15/90","math.FA",,"  Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space, let $E$ be a Banach space, and let
$C(X,E)$ stand for the Banach space of $E$-valued continuous functions on $X$
under the uniform norm. In this paper we characterize Integral operators (in
the sense of Grothendieck) on $C(X,E)$ spaces in term of their representing
vector measures. This is then used to give some applications to Nuclear
operators on $C(X,E)$ spaces.
