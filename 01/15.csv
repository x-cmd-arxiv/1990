an L-structure then P(M) is the L-structure formed as the substructure of M
with domain {a: M models P(a)}. Now suppose T is a complete first order theory
in L with infinite models. Following Hodges, we say that T is relatively
lambda-categorical if whenever M, N models T, P(M)=P(N), |P(M)|= lambda then
there is an isomorphism i:M-> N which is the identity on P(M). T is relatively
categorical if it is relatively lambda-categorical for every lambda. The
question arises whether the relative lambda-categoricity of T for some lambda
>|T| implies that T is relatively categorical.
  In this paper, we provide an example, for every k>0, of a theory T_k and an
L_{omega_1 omega} sentence varphi_k so that T_k is relatively
aleph_n-categorical for n < k and varphi_k is aleph_n-categorical for n<k but
T_k is not relatively beth_k-categorical and varphi_k is not
beth_k-categorical.

theory. The apparatus to assign systems of cardinal invariants to models of a
first order theory (or determine its impossibility) is developed in [Sh:a]. It
is natural to try to extend this theory to classes of models which are
described in other ways. Work on the classification theory for nonelementary
classes [Sh:88] and for universal classes [Sh:300] led to the conclusion that
an axiomatic approach provided the best setting for developing a theory of
wider application. In the first chapter we describe the axioms on which the
remainder of the article depends and give some examples and context to justify
this level of generality. The study of universal classes takes as a primitive
the notion of closing a subset under functions to obtain a model. We replace
that concept by the notion of a prime model. We begin the detailed discussion
of this idea in Chapter II. One of the important contributions of
classification theory is the recognition that large models can often be
analyzed by means of a family of small models indexed by a tree of height at
most omega. More precisely, the analyzed model is prime over such a tree.
Chapter III provides sufficient conditions for prime models over such trees to
exist.
