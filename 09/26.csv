the Ising model on diamond-like hierarchical lattices. It is known that the
singularities of free energy of this model lie on the Julia set of some
rational endomorphism $f$ related to the action of the Migdal-Kadanoff
renorm-group. We study the asymptotics of free energy when temperature goes
along hyperbolic geodesics to the boundary of an attractive basin of $f$. We
prove that for almost all (with respect to the harmonic measure) geodesics the
complex critical exponent is common, and compute it.
