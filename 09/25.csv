proof is closely related to the theorem of Fritz John characterising ellipsoids
of maximal volume contained in convex bodies.

"math/9201218",,"Keith Ball","The plank problem for symmetric bodies",,,"10.1007/BF01245089","Banach Archive 9/25/90","math.MG math.FA",,"  Given a symmetric convex body $C$ and $n$ hyperplanes in an Euclidean space,
there is a translate of a multiple of $C$, at least ${1\over n+1}$ times as
large, inside $C$, whose interior does not meet any of the hyperplanes. The
result generalizes Bang's solution of the plank problem of Tarski and has
applications to Diophantine approximation.
