"math/9201273","John W. Milnor","John W. Milnor","Remarks on iterated cubic maps",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1990/6","math.DS",,"  This note will discuss the dynamics of iterated cubic maps from the real or
complex line to itself, and will describe the geography of the parameter space
for such maps. It is a rough survey with few precise statements or proofs, and
depends strongly on work by Douady, Hubbard, Branner and Rees.
