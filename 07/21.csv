classifying the complemented subspaces of $X_{p}$. We characterize the
complemented subspaces of $X_{p}$ which are isomorphic to $X_{p}$ by showing
that such a space must contain a canonical complemented subspace isomorphic to
$X_{p}.$ We also give some characterizations of complemented subspaces of
$X_{p}$ isomorphic to $\ell_{p}\oplus \ell_{2}.$
