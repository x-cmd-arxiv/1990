"math/9201272","John W. Milnor","John W. Milnor","Dynamics in one complex variable: introductory lectures",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1990/5","math.DS math.CV",,"  These notes study the dynamics of iterated holomorphic mappings from a
Riemann surface to itself, concentrating on the classical case of rational maps
of the Riemann sphere. They are based on introductory lectures given at Stony
Brook during the Fall Term of 1989-90. These lectures are intended to introduce
the reader to some key ideas in the field, and to form a basis for further
study. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the rudiments of complex
variable theory and of two-dimensional differential geometry.
