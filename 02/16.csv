"math/9201208",,"William B. Johnson and Gideon Schechtman","Remarks on Talagrand's deviation inequality for Rademacher functions",,,,"Banach Archive 2/16/90","math.PR math.FA",,"  Recently Talagrand [T] estimated the deviation of a function on $\{0,1\}^n$
from its median in terms of the Lipschitz constant of a convex extension of $f$
to $\ell ^n_2$; namely, he proved that
  $$P(|f-M_f| > c) \le 4 e^{-t^2/4\sigma ^2}$$ where $\sigma$ is the Lipschitz
constant of the extension of $f$ and $P$ is the natural probability on
$\{0,1\}^n$.
  Here we extend this inequality to more general product probability spaces; in
particular, we prove the same inequality for $\{0,1\}^n$ with the product
measure $((1-\eta)\delta _0 + \eta \delta _1)^n$. We believe this should be
useful in proofs involving random selections. As an illustration of possible
applications we give a simple proof (though not with the right dependence on
$\varepsilon$) of the Bourgain, Lindenstrauss, Milman result [BLM] that for
$1\le r < s \le 2$ and $\varepsilon >0$, every $n$-dimensional subspace of $L_s
\ (1+\varepsilon)$-embeds into $\ell ^N_r$ with $N = c(r,s,\varepsilon)n$.
